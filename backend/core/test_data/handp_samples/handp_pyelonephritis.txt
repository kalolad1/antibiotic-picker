Imaging:

A renal ultrasound is ordered to evaluate the kidneys and urinary tract.
Assessment:
Based on the clinical presentation, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the preliminary diagnosis is pyelonephritis, a bacterial infection of the kidney.

Plan:

Intravenous Antibiotics: Initiate empiric antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone pending urine culture and sensitivity results.
Pain Management: Administer analgesics for pain relief, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Fluids: Ensure adequate hydration with intravenous fluids.
Renal Ultrasound: Evaluate the kidneys and urinary tract to assess for any anatomical abnormalities or complications.
Consultation: Consult a urologist for further evaluation and management if necessary.
Follow-up: Arrange a follow-up appointment in 48-72 hours to re-evaluate the patient's progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed.
This history and physical documentation serves as a preliminary assessment and plan for a patient with suspected pyelonephritis. Individual patient management may vary based on clinical judgment and specific patient characteristics.
