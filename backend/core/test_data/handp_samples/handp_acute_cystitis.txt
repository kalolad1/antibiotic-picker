**Assessment and Plan:**
Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient is diagnosed with acute cystitis, likely caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI). The absence of fever or costovertebral angle tenderness suggests that the infection has not ascended to the upper urinary tract.

**Plan:**
1. **Urinalysis:** A urine sample will be collected for urinalysis and culture to confirm the diagnosis and identify the responsible pathogen.
2. **Antibiotic Therapy:** Pending culture results, empiric antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily for 3 days will be initiated.
3. **Fluids:** The patient will be advised to increase fluid intake to help flush out the infection.
4. **Analgesics:** Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen may be recommended for symptom relief.
5. **Follow-Up:** The patient will be instructed to follow up in 3 days to assess response to treatment and adjust therapy based on culture results if necessary.

**Education:**
The patient will be educated about the importance of completing the full course of antibiotics, maintaining good hygiene, and practicing safe sexual intercourse to prevent future UTIs. She will also be advised to seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or persist.

**Disposition:**
The patient is advised to return to the clinic for follow-up in three days. If symptoms worsen or fail to improve, she should seek immediate medical attention.
